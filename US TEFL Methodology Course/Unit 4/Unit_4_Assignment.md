**Task 1**  

A gap fill activity would be work well in this case. It can be tailored to match the skill level and comfort of the class, or it can be easily expanded to include condtionals in future lessons if desired.  

Teacher passes out a worksheet with sentences that are missing verbs. Students must fill in the blanks using the correct past simple form of the verb. The infinitive form of the verbs could be given in the sentence e.g.  

1. I ____ *(go)* to the cinema last night. -> *went*
2. They ____ *(see)* a scary movie. -> *saw*
3. We ____ *(walk)* to the coffee shop this morning. -> *walked*

Alternatively a word bank could be utilized to provide some extra challenge by requiring the students to identify the correct infinitive verb.

**Task 2**

To get the students talking, the teacher could divide them up into pairs or small groups of 3 or 4 (depending on class size) and get them discussing a hypothetical trip. In this case we could kick the activity off with asking the students to come up with their dream vacation. "If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do?"
The teacher would then ask them to discuss their vacation plans in their small group expanding from there using the second conditional.
The students would then take turn expanding that story, for example:  
1. "If I could travel anywhere, I would travel to Hawaii."  
2. "If I went to Hawaii, I could relax on the beach."  
2. "If I didn't have to go to work, I would explore Europe."   

Afterwords, the students could present their dream vacations to the class.
