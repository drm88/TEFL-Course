## Task 1: Target Language – Like / Don’t Like

1. Show pictures of various foods (e.g., pizza, broccoli, ice cream).
2. Use gestures to illustrate the TL. Smiling and thumbs up for “like,” frowning and thumbs down for “don’t like.”
3. Ask students, “Do I like it?” and let them guess.
4. Repeat with student volunteers calling out their food preferences.
5. Have them respond with things such as “I like pizza!” or “I don’t like broccoli!”
6. Write the sentences on the board, underline "like" and "don’t like."

## Task 2: Target Language – May I borrow a pencil?

1. Act out writing on some paper, but pretend you don't have a pencil.
2. Approach a student, point at their pencil and say clearly: “May I borrow a pencil?”
3. Accept the pencil with a big “Thank you!” and a big smile to show your relief and thankfulness. Make sure to return the pencil when done writing.
4. To further demonstrate the use of the TL, do this with other common objects used around the classroom like a ruler or a marker.
5. Ask students what they think it means to borrow. Encourage guesses, make sure they know the borrowing something also means returning it when done.
6. Write the phrase on the board and underline: May I + borrow + a pencil?
