# Unit 12 Assignment

1. Lead-in (~5 mins) Student - Student

    * Show students a few pictures of people doing daily activities (e.g., cooking, reading, showering).
    * Have the students call out the answers to some questions such as: "What do you usually do in the evening?"
    * Ask them: "Have you ever been interrupted while doing something?" - Elicit a few examples of interrupted activities.

2. Presentation (10-15 mins) Teacher - Student, Student - Student

    * Narrate a short story about your previous day, such as: "Last night, I was cooking dinner when my friend called.", or "I was watching TV when the power went out." Write these sentences on the board.
    * Be mindful of the pronunciation and stress on the continuous vs interrupting actions here. Demonstrate that linking words (while, when) can have a bit more intonation on them.
    * Ask a few guided questions to ge the students talking: "What was I doing when my friend called?", "Was I cooking before or after the phone call?", "Did the TV stop because of the power outage?"
    * Highlight the past continuous form here, Subject + was/were + verb, underline this part of the sentence. Make sure to point out the linking words here too.
    * To illustrate the meaning of interruption, draw a timeline on the board: show the first (longer, past continuous) activity occurring, and then the interruption (shorter, past simple) happening during that activity.
    * Finish up by asking a few concept checking questions:
        1. Did the phone call happen during cooking or after cooking? (During)
        2. Did I finish cooking? (Yes, but it was interrupted)
        3. Was I able to finish watching TV? (No, the power was out)
