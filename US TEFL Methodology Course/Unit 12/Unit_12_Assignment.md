# Unit 12 Assignment

1. Lead-in (~5 mins) Student - Student

    * Show students a few pictures of people doing daily activities (e.g., cooking, reading, showering).
    * Have the students call out the answers to some questions such as: "What do you usually do in the evening?"
    * Ask them: "Have you ever been interrupted while doing something?" - Elicit a few examples of interrupted activities.

2. Presentation (10-15 mins) Teacher - Student, Student - Student

    * Narrate a short story about your previous day, such as: "Last night, I was cooking dinner when my friend called.", or "I was watching TV when the power went out." Write these sentences on the board.
    * Be mindful of the pronunciation and stress on the continuous vs interrupting actions here. Demonstrate that linking words (while, when) can have a bit more intonation on them.
    * Ask a few guided questions to get the students talking: "What was I doing when my friend called?", "Was I cooking before or after the phone call?", "Did the TV stop because of the power outage?"
    * Highlight the past continuous form here, Subject + was/were + present participle, underline this part of the sentence. Make sure to point out the linking words here too, as well as the present participle to point out the difference between this and a gerund - action vs subject.
    * To illustrate the meaning of interruption, draw a timeline on the board: show the first (longer, past continuous) activity occurring, and then the interruption (shorter, past simple) happening during that activity.
    * Finish up by asking a few concept checking questions such as:
        * Am I cooking now? (No, last night - present continuous)
        * Did that phone call happen last night? (Yes - past simple)
        * Am I cooking dinner tonight? (Yes - future)

3. Practice - Controlled (10 mins) Paired work

    * Divide the students up into pairs.
    * Have the groups complete a gap fill worksheet. Examples:
        * I ______ (walk) to school when it ______ (start) to rain.
        * They ______ (have) dinner when the doorbell ______ (ring).
        * She ______ (study) when her friend ______ (arrive).
    * Students present the answers to the class, correct the answers as a class.

4. Production - Free (15-20 mins) Student - Student, Group

    * Set up a group role-play, use some real/some fanciful scenarios to demonstrate interrupted situations.
    * Divide the class into pairs or small groups and provide a scenario to each to riff  off of eg. "You are being interviewed for a job when something unexpected happens.", You’re having dinner when theres a loud bang at the door.", "You're walking in the park when suddenly a monster leaps out from behind a tree"
    * The first student will then sets the scene using past continuous: “I was talking to my boss when...”
    * The other students then ask questions or otherwise react naturally “What did you do?”, “Who was at the door?", "Were you scared?"
    * Encourage the natural flow of the conversation, and use of the TL to continue the scenario.
    * The teacher should listen for accuracy and fluency. Make a mental note of good language and common errors. If anyone seems stuck maybe offer up a "Yes, and...?" to keep the conversation moving.

5. Wrap up (~5 mins) Teacher - Student

    * Briefly go over any common errors errors and correct them as a class to reinforce the TL.
    * For homework ask students to write 2 short dialogues where someone is interrupted while doing something, they can share them next time class meets.
    * Praise the students for their hard work and participation!
