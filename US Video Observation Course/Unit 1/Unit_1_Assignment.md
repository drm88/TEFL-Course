# Unit 1 Assignment

1. Pacing
This stuck out to me the most, the teacher seemed to rush though the lesson at the detriment of the class. The vibe I got from this was that they were uncomfortable being in front of the class or perhaps unprepared for the lesson. I can relate, I'm not the best public speaker. What works for me in this situation is to utilize visuals, something that will take the focus off of me directly.

2. Engagement
The students seemed bored and disengaged throughout the lesson. They're not going to retain as much if they do not find the lesson interesting or engaging. I would try and pick activities that get the students talking to each other or moving, the goal here would be to increase interaction amongst the students and with the teacher.

3. Interaction
The teach was talking at the students, not with them. My most memorable classes were the ones in which a teacher creates a collaborative environment. Incorporating more student to student talking time would go a long way here.
