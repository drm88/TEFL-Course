This lesson will be conducted over Zoom, or similar software.

Target Language: Useful phrases related to getting around in a city:

* "How do I get to...?"

* "Can I walk there?"
* "Which bus/train should I take?"
* "Where’s the nearest station?"
* "How long does it take?"
* "Do I need to change trains?"
* "It’s just around the corner."

## Before

* Pre-Lesson Task (email a few days before):
Send the student a short dialogue featuring the TL above in context (created by teacher).

>Tourist: Excuse me, how do I get to the central market?
>Local: Take bus 42 from here. Get off at Central Street.
>Tourist: Is it far?
>Local: Not really. It takes about 15 minutes.

The student should read the dialogue and highlight any phrases they don’t know and we will go over them during the lesson.

Once the student has read the dialogue, they will match the following phrases with their meanings.

1. How do I get to...?
2. Can I walk there?
3. It’s just around the corner.

* It's very close.
* Is it possible to go on foot?
* What is the way to go there?

An answer key will also be provided in the email.

## During (30 minutes)

1. Warm-up & Review (5 mins)

    * Ask the student if they went over the pre-lesson task.
    * Share screen with the dialogue again and quickly review TL and go over any phrases the student didn't understand.
    * Elicit meaning and pronunciation for key phrases (focus on intonation of questions like "Is it far?").

2. Listening & Comprehension (5 mins)

    * Play a short audio (recorded by teacher) of a tourist asking for directions.
    * Check for comprehension, ask the student questions like: "Where does the tourist want to go?", "What method of transport should they use?", "Is it far?"

3. Controlled Speaking Practice (5 - 10 mins)

    * Now that student has warmed up and gotten some listening practice, do a role-play of a tourist asking for directions. The student will be tourist, the teacher will be a local.
    * Using the screen share feature in the software, pull up a downtown area of a city in Google maps. Drop a pin at a hotel to show the student where they are at and have them pick a point of interest they would like to visit.
    * Have the student ask you how to get to the destination. Start off by giving them an example like "Ask me how to get to the museum" and elicit more questions, give gentle guidance as needed.

4. Freer Practice – Travel role-play (10 mins)

    * In this scenario Student is arriving in London. They need to get from the airport to their hotel and then visit tourist spots.
    * The teacher will act as an info desk attendant at the airport, and later as a concierge at the hotel. The student will ask for help getting around.
    * Kick off the role-play by demonstrating the first question ("Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to...?" "Start by going..."), the student will ask follow up questions and continue the dialogue.
    * Encourage use of TL phrases from before: "How do I get to...?", "Is it far?", "Can I walk there?", etc.
    * Provide corrections gently and recycle TL naturally. If the student is feeling confident, encourage them to come up with their own questions.

5. Wrap-up (2 mins)

    * Praise the student for their effort and engagement. Recap the key phrases used.
    * Ask them which phrases do you think will be useful when you travel?
    * Share chat log with phrases for future review.

## After

* Follow-up Task: Writing Practice (submitted by email)
* The student just arrived in a new city for vacation, and mom is anxious to know how the flight was. Have them write a short message (maybe 5 - 7 sentences) explaining how they got from the airport to the hotel. Use 3 or 4 new phrases from today’s lesson.
* Example: "Hi Mom, I arrived in New York this morning! I asked a local how to get to my hotel..."
