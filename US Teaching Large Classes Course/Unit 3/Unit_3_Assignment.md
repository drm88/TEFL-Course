# Assignment 3

PPP structure
TL: Making requests

1. Lead-in (~10 minutes) S-S groups

    * Divide the class up into cluster groups
    * Display 2 or 3 images of people making requests: a student asking to borrow a pen, another of a person asking for directions etc.
    * In their groups, students discuss: "What do you think is happening in these pictures?", "What would you say in these situations?". Have the students answer out loud as they come up with answers.
    * Teacher circulates, listens, and notes common phrases or errors to revisit later.

2. Presentation (15 - 20 minutes)

    * Stage 1 (Meaning): Pass out some handouts for each group with short dialogues on them.
        * Each dialogue shows someone making a polite request such as: Alice "Can I borrow your charger for a minute?" Bob: "Sure, no problem." Each dialogue will highlight one of the target phrases (listed below)
        * Students read the dialogues and match the phrases to the correct meanings. e.g. Asking permission politely or asking someone to do something.
        * Each group works together to agree on the best match and compares with a neighboring group. Teacher circulates and prompts discussion with questions like "What’s the person trying to do here?" and "Do you think this sounds polite or rude?"
    * Stage 2 (Form): On the board underline the structure of a phrase in the dialogue to show how its constructed. "Can I + base verb...?", "Would you mind + verb-ing"
        * Have the groups work out the structure of the remaining phrases.
        * Elicit answers from the groups. Write a few correct structures on the board with group input.
        * Some concept checking questions: "Is this for now or the past?", "Am I offering or requesting something?"
    * Stage 3 (Pronunciation): Demonstrate some of the target phrases with natural intonation.
        * Have the class repeat a few phrases after the teacher, then have them pair off within their groups and take turns speaking the phrases to each other.
        * Have the students focus on a polite, natural tone here. Highlight that native speakers soften their tone when making requests.
        * Float between the groups and listen for correct intonation, gently correct if needed.

    * Target Phrases:
        * Can I borrow your... ?
        * Can you help me with... ?
        * Could you...  please?
        * Would you mind... ?
        * Do you think you could... ?
        * Is it okay if I... ?
        * I was wondering if you could...
        * Would it be alright if I... ?

3. Controlled Practice (~15 minutes)

    * Activity: “Polite or Not?” sorting game
    * Each group gets a mix of request phrases (some polite, some too direct). They sort them into "Polite" or "Not Polite" columns. Then they rephrase the "Not polite" ones using the TL.
    * Group leaders share their groups polite and one rephrased versions with another group. Have the students discuss if they think these are correct, why or why not.
    * Teacher will monitor and clarify as necessary.

4. Production (Free Practice) (15 minutes)

    * Have the students pair off and role-play making requests.
    * Each group gets a set of real-life scenarios (asking to borrow a bike, asking for help with homework, asking to stay out late). Students take turns creating and acting out the short role-plays.
    * Group leaders can assess using a checklist (Did they use polite TL? Was it natural?).
    * Teacher circulates and observes, also is available to help the group leaders assess if needed. After the activity discuss common themes observed.

5. Wrap-up (Time permitting)
    * Briefly review the TL, on the board have the class match phrases to situations, or guess the missing polite phrase.
